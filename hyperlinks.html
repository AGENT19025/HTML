            <h1 style="font-size:18px">BUSSTOP IN ANTWERP</h1>
            <p>I was waiting in a busstop in Antwerp. I live in Belgium and it was quite late. I just had theatre practice and I was waiting on the bus, when a man showed up.
                 I think he had a mental disability, so I tried to be nice when he asked me something. After a while, he came closer and he wanted to me to smoke one of his cigarettes. 
                I declined and he started yelling a bit. He told me to sit down on the bench in the busstop. Because of the strange situation and the fact that I was there alone,
                 i decided to obley while waiting on my bus to come so I could get away. After a while, he wanted me to hug him and give him a kiss on his cheeck. He took a seat on my lap and 
                 I told him I didn't want that, and that he should keep his distance. He started crying, asking for a hug again. He wanted me to stay seated. This kept going for a while and
                then I said to him that I was going to leave and just walk home. I crossed the street to go to the other side of the busstop on the other side of the road, 
                because there was a yound man standing. He didn't do anything as a bystand, but I felt a little bit safer. Eventually, I walked home calling my boyfriend, as 
                emotional support but also as a safter mechanism. I truly think i'm not the first victim.</p>

            <h4 style="color:orangered">The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h4>
            <p>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”
                When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.
                “Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down the hill.
                Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.
                As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.
                Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn’t come to help.
                At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.
                
                “There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.
                
                An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”</p>
